Results from the Pedagogy Gap Survey give teachers actionable information on where to improve their practice. Educators learn what students think is most important to learn, as well as where the classroom needs most improvement and is best performing. Educators use these metrics to focus on areas that make the greatest impact on their students.

The graphs below reflect the learning preferences and perceptions of students. The Avg Score is the class average, between one and five, of all students who took the survey, where five is the highest possible score. The Class Preferences Score converts the survey responses into a score that reflects the educational priorities of the class. Educators should improve their practice in areas where the greatest gaps between Avg Score and Class Preferences Score occur. 

The "pedagogy gaps" between the teacher's current practice and students' ideal learning expereince occurs in the context of six factors. They are defined below:

Pedagogy Gap Factors
<dl>
  <dt>Interactions</dt>
  <dd>distinguishes how students learn from different kinds of interactions.</dd>

  <dt>Thinking</dt>
  <dd>represents the concrete techinical skills needed to succeed in life.</dd>

  <dt>Discipline</dt>
  <dd>describes how students engage with the desired learning outcome.</dd>

  <dt>Expectations</dt>
  <dd>the storyline a student creates about her ability and need to learn with the world at large.</dd>

  <dt>Willing<dt>
  <dd>the characteristic of a learning experience that either encourages or discourages the learner along some learning path.</dd>

  <dt>Direction</dt>
  <dd>describes the student's agency to decide upon and control the learning experience.</dd>
</dl>

These factors are further broken down into four sub-factors. Click on the Class Responses by Factor to see more information.
